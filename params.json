You don't need any special drivers or additional\r\nsoftware to run it -- the only requirement is the python-uinput module.\r\n\r\n# Connecting the joystick\r\n\r\nTo use the script you'll need to connect the Amiga joystick to the Raspberry\r\nGPIOs.  The Amiga joystick port is simply a female DE-9 (aka Serial Port)\r\nconnector.  There are 6 data lines (4 directions and 2 buttons) -- these need\r\nto be connected to the GPIOs.  Besides that there is a ground pin and a power\r\nsupply (+5V) pin.  The power pin is optional, most joysticks only need it for\r\nautofire.\r\n\r\nSuggested connection of DE-9 pins to GPIOs (BCM numbering):\r\n* pin 1 -- forward -- GPIO 6\r\n* pin 2 -- back -- GPIO 13\r\n* pin 3 -- left -- GPIO 19\r\n* pin 4 -- right -- GPIO 26\r\n* pin 5 -- not used\r\n* pin 6 -- button 1 (fire) -- GPIO 20\r\n* pin 7 -- power supply +5V\r\n* pin 8 -- ground\r\n* pin 9 -- button 2 -- GPIO 21\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use different GPIO pins, change the `CHANNELS` mapping in the\r\n`amiga-joystick.py` script.\r\n\r\n# Event mapping\r\n\r\nBy default, the Amiga Joystick is detected as a keyboard.  Joystick movement is\r\ntranslated to arrow keys, button A (fire) is translated to left CTRL, button B\r\n(often unused) is translated to left shift.  This mapping allows playing Amiga\r\ngames on RetroPie with the uae4all2 emulator.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you'd like to map the joystick directions or buttons to different\r\nkeys, change the `CHANNELS` mapping in the `amiga-joystick.py` script.\r\n\r\n# Running the script\r\n\r\nAfter you've connected everything, you can simply start the script from the\r\ncommand line as root:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo ./amiga-joystick.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also make the script run automatically on startup by adding the\r\nfollowing line to `/etc/rc.local`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/some/path/amiga-joystick.py &\r\n```\r\n\r\n# More Pictures\r\n\r\n![Image](img/2.jpg)\r\n![Image](img/3.jpg)\r\n![Image](img/4.jpg)\r\n",
