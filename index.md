Connect your old Amiga joystick to a Raspberry

# How it works

The `amiga-joystick.py` script reads data from RPi GPIO pins and translates
them to Linux input events.  You don't need any special drivers or additional
software to run it -- the only requirement is the python-uinput module.

# Connecting the joystick

To use the script you'll need to connect the Amiga joystick to the Raspberry
GPIOs.  The Amiga joystick port is simply a female DE-9 (aka Serial Port)
connector.  There are 6 data lines (4 directions and 2 buttons) -- these need
to be connected to the GPIOs.  Besides that there is a ground pin and a power
supply (+5V) pin.  The power pin is optional, most joysticks only need it for
autofire.

Suggested connection of DE-9 pins to GPIOs (BCM numbering):
* pin 1 -- forward -- GPIO 6
* pin 2 -- back -- GPIO 13
* pin 3 -- left -- GPIO 19
* pin 4 -- right -- GPIO 26
* pin 5 -- not used
* pin 6 -- button 1 (fire) -- GPIO 20
* pin 7 -- power supply +5V
* pin 8 -- ground
* pin 9 -- button 2 -- GPIO 21

If you'd like to use different GPIO pins, change the `CHANNELS` mapping in the
`amiga-joystick.py` script.

# Event mapping

By default, the Amiga Joystick is detected as a keyboard.  Joystick movement is
translated to arrow keys, button A (fire) is translated to left CTRL, button B
(often unused) is translated to left shift.  This mapping allows playing Amiga
games on RetroPie with the uae4all2 emulator.

Again, if you'd like to map the joystick directions or buttons to different
keys, change the `CHANNELS` mapping in the `amiga-joystick.py` script.

# Running the script

After you've connected everything, you can simply start the script from the
command line as root:

```
sudo ./amiga-joystick.py
```

You can also make the script run automatically on startup by adding the
following line to `/etc/rc.local`:

```
/some/path/amiga-joystick.py &
```
